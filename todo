bug: room-actual and extAir codes show when blower not blowing
  (room-actual shows from fan delay end to ac delay end)

change timing_acDelay back to room-based
    emit timing_acDelay during whole off time
    each room decides to show D

when timing_acDelay or ctrl_thaw or all dampers are closed
  turn on dampers in all rooms with the same mode as sys or in fan mode
  if still none on, then turn all on
