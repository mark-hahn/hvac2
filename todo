remove all acDelay logging stuff

bug: room-actual and extAir codes show when blower not blowing
  (room-actual shows from fan delay end to ac delay end)

when timing_acDelay or ctrl_thaw or all dampers are closed
  turn on dampers in all rooms with the same mode as sys or in fan mode
  if still none on, then turn all on

Blower runs for one sec when booting app
